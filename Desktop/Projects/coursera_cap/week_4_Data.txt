For this project we will be using the postal code and district in from wikipedia which we will scrape for a data set. Then we will use geopy to get the coordinates of the place. Once we have the coordinates of the neighbourhood then we start by pinpointing the locations on the map using the folium package.
After the initial inspection we are now ready to dive into the data of the actual eateries around the area. For this we will be using the foursquare api to get details about the restaurants/eateries in their respective areas. Once we have made our custom URL we can search for various location and details like their distance from their particular area and the type/cusine they have which will help us narrow down the what kind of cuisine can be profitable in the particular area
