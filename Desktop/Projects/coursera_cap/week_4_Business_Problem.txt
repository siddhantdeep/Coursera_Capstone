The analysis is to help people to start their own Food related establishment in the Toronto area. Toronto being one of the major cities in Canada and even the most populous city in Canada so starting a restaurant can be a major risk as the land is very expensive and options are plenty so if one does not take the right approach it will lead to shut down even if the food is good because one is not able to compete with other in the same business
This analysis project is meant to look into the various eateries  in and around Toronto. This project will help to determine the location of eateries in their particular neighbourhoods and get the details of restaurants. This would help us understand what kind approach one could take to be competitive in the area
